Today I worked on:

* CSS and ReadMe

I wrote up our ReadMe and imported images for the wireframes markdown file.

I learned about how to drag and drop png files into VSCode, as well as dragging in other markdown files to create links to them.  This will be super useful going forward when making ReadMes for future projects.

01/25/23

Today I worked on:

* Filter buttons and unit tests.

I finalized the filter button code with Adrien, and created my unit test.  We then continued working on deployment.

I'm picking up more on UseEffect, and ways it can be useful when using functional coding in React.

01/24/23

Today I worked on:

* Filter buttons

I worked some more on filter buttons, and toward the end of the day Adrien helped as I was having issues with getting my code to function and retrieve the data to alter the display.

Filters are harder than I was expecting, since the data being accessed isn't contained in the front end.

01/23/23

Today I worked on:

* Filter buttons

I reviewed some resources online (React documentation, YouTube videos, assorted tutorials, etc) to learn more about how to create a filter button that would let us filter the inventory.  I began some code mockup.

* Today I worked on:

Deployment

Suk and I began working on CI/CD, with setting up the Caprover Instance and deploying the accounts microservice.
So far deployment seems easier than expected, but I'm expecting that to change as we deploy more microservices.

01/19/23

Today I worked on:

* Inventory microservice front end

Today I completed the pet form, and started looking into how to build filter buttons.

01/18/23

Today I worked on:

* Inventory microservice front end

Today I continued my review of functional React, and began working on the pet form.

01/17/23

Today I worked on:

* Inventory microservice front end

Today I reviewed some videos on functional React vs class based React.

Functional React is really starting to click, and I can see how it's easier than class based once you have the basics down.

01/13/23

Today I worked on:

* Inventory microservice front end

Suk, Alex, and I divided up our portion of the front end into smaller tasks to work on individually, and began creating mockups of our sections.

01/12/23

* Today I worked on:

Front end; Merging Microservice Backends to Main

Those of us who worked on the inventory microservice backend began reviewing React resources (lectures, documentation, etc) while Adrien and Alex finished resolving auth issues on the accounts backend.  Afterwards the whole team worked together on merging the two microservice development branches into main, which included double checking all functionality post-merge.   We then delegated out front end microservices, and discussed some of the basics of our plans for the UI/UX layout.

01/11/23

Today I worked on:

* The inventory microservice backend

Hutch, Suk, and I utilized VSCode liveshare and a Discord voice channel to finish working on the backend for the inventory microservice and completed all testing of the code in Swagger. Inventory microservice backend was fully functional.

01/10/23

Today I worked on:

* The inventory microservice backend

Hutch, Suk, and I utilized VSCode liveshare and a Discord voice channel to continue working on the backend for the inventory microservice and began testing the code in Swagger.

01/09/23

Today I worked on:

* The inventory microservice backend

Hutch, Suk, and I utilized VSCode liveshare and a Discord voice channel to start creating the backend for the inventory microservice.

I learned about using liveshare in VSCode which seems like a great way to collaborate with people while avoiding potential merge conflicts.
