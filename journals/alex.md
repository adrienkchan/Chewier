Today, I worked on:

- I was able to make a working unit test. I asked for help and realized that I just had to run pytest in the container, which solved all my problems. I realized that I should have ask for help sooner, instead of suffering on my own. As a group we did all our merges and solved the merge conflicts.

Today, I worked on:

- I went over unit test lesson in learn. I wasn't able to figure out how to make the test work. I ran into a bunch of errors with import errors and the test interacting with my database.

Today, I worked on:

- I was able to finish the bug I had with the search bar making the products shrink. I realized that the search bar is just filtering the list of products displayed, so it shouldn't affect the actual css of the page. Then I realized that the cards that help the picture and text wasn't taking up its maximum width within the container around it. So i just made the class for the card take up 100% of the space, which fixed the problem. My group also started to work on ci/cd, and since Suk already finished her part of the page she was the main person working on ci/cd.

Today, I worked on:

- I was assigned to make the search bar for the page my group was working on. So I searched up some videos on how to do it and was able to make the search bar filter our products and show the filtered products on the page. But there was a problem with how the products were displayed, when 3 or less products were left after the filter. If there was only 3 or less products then the picture and the text would shrink.

Today, I worked on:

- I realized that the reason my account detail page wasn't showing the information was because I forgot I had to actually make the token, so the account was logged in(I felt so dumb). Then I added some links that went to the view pets page and pet form page. My group also got together to make 2 seperate groups to work on the 2 big react pages. The group I got was me, Suk, and Lauren.

Today, I worked on:

- I was confused on our Auth.js file so, I asked for help from Adrien, who was able to get his page to work, so he explained it to me. After Adrien helped me, I went back to my account detail page and added auth to it, but I wasn't able to figure out why it wasn't showing any information on the page.

## Jan. 17, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- I worked on my account detail page. Me and my team didn't really know how to use authentication in the front end, so we had to look and see how to do it in the learn, so spend the day looking over 'Front-End Authorization' in learn.

## Jan. 13, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Adrien and I finished the authentication endpoints and checked them, we met as a group to see how we would divide the frontend between all of us. I was tasked with working on the account detail page, so I looked back at my old project to remember how to do react.

## Jan. 12, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Adrien and I worked on remaking our account endpoints with authentication. We were confused on how to use hashed password with our database and endpoints. We figured out that we needed to change our tables and we had some typos with our code.

## Jan. 11, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Adrien and I realized that we didn't really know how to implement authentication, so we spent most of the day dedicated to us just reading over the authentication lesson in learn. We also checked in with our group and helped eachother with some problems.

## Jan. 10, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Adrien and I finished the endpoints for accounts and pets. We were able to make everything work on the fast api docs in our local host. But we realized after we finished the enpoints that we were going to have to heavily change our account enpoints because we didn't consider authentication.

## Jan. 9, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Adrien and I started working on the accounts backend(accounts and pets) using code live share to work on it at the same time. We were able to set up our migration for the tables, and we got all of our account enpoints working.
